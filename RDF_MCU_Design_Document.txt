					Overview

This program replaces the solid state control of the Ramsey/WA2EBY DDF1 radio direction finder with a 
micro-controller (uC).  Current thought is to base to base the uC on the Arduino Uno board.  Below is the uC flowchart that needs to be implemented in order to replace most 
aspects of the solid state functions, plus give additional capabilities.  The intention is to allow 
multiple DDF units to be permanently mounted at certain locations, ability to have remote turn on and 
communicate the signal strength and bearing to the unknown transmitter (fox).  This will be implemented 
by the following hardware: DDF1, GPS, Arduino uC, a 2M receiver and an APRS transceiver.

The DDF1 main board is tasked with the following: high and low pass filtering of the input audio (from an 
external receiver), a digital filter for extracting the tone and generating a digital form of the 500Hz 
Doppler tone from the sampled audio, an additional low pass filter to smooth the digital filter output, 
followed by a zero crossing detector. Additionally, the timing pulse train for selecting which one of the 
four antennas is currently selected, and triggering the LED display for direction.

The uC version of this system will have the following capabilities: Ability to generate the pulse train 
directly from the uC (eliminating the 74HC42 and one LM555), no LED display will be available (eliminating 
74HC4515 and 74HC161) since bearing will be given via APRS. The ATMega328P on the Arduino board has a 
digital filter capability therefore 74HC4051 will be eliminated as well. A built-in receiver has not been 
chosen at this time, however, the Freescale MC13260 SoC two-way radio is a possibility as it gives several 
functions. First, it provides both a  receiver and a RSSI pin allowing for a 'S' number to be generated 
for the signal strength coming in, and secondly, it provides a transmitter to send the data back out onto 
the APRS system.

No modifications should be required to the antenna switcher circuit(s).


					Flowchart

The following is the sequence of events that must occur for the system to work correctly.
1) Initialize uC: set pins for input/output/PWM, initialize variables, preform system check, 
   ensure GPS has fix, transceiver is operational.
2) Ensure that receiver is on the correct frequency, transmitter is on APRS frequency
3) Begin spinning antennas (each one on for 0.5ms), ensure that the 500Hz tone is coming into the 
   system (via frequency counter/digital filter), autocorrect if tone is outside set limits by changing 
   spin speed (+/-50Hz)
4) Check RSSI for signal strength, load it into a var
5) Detect direction of signal, load result into var
6) Get GPS fix, create GPS APRS message
6a) If mobile, get last heading indication of 5MPH or faster, otherwise for fixed station use programed 
    heading info
7) Create APRS DF message, i.e. DFS(signal strength number)(antenna height)(direction from lookup table) ' '
   (bearing in xxx degrees) 
8) Remove receiver from antenna(s), stop spinning antennas, enable transmitter, transmit APRS GPS, Heading 
   and DF message(s) (APRS 1.0 spec page 33)
9) Stop transmitting, go back to #2 above

					APRS DF Message Format

The APRS DF message format is composed of several items:
Portion		Description
DF		Prefix for the DF comment
Sn		Signal strength 0-9, i.e. S0, S1...S9 See below
h		antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) (see PHG calculation)
g		gain of antenna (see PHG calculation)
dir		direction of antenna or omni (see PHG calculation)
' '		single whitespace
bearing		this is the calculated bearing

What the 'S' numbers mean:
    0 No signal detected what-so-ever
    1 Detectible signal (Maybe)
    2 Detectible signal (certain but not copyable)
    3 Weak signal marginally readable
    4 Noisy but copyable
    5 Some noise but easy to copy
    6 Good signal with detectible noise
    7 Near Full-quieting signal
    8 Dead Full-quieting signal no noise detectible
    9 Extremely strong signal "pins the meter"

What the height numbers mean:
0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9
10	20	40	80	160	320	640	1280	2560	5120 feet

What the gain numbers mean:
0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9
0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9 dB

What the direction numbers mean:
0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8
omni	45NE	90E	135SE	180S	225SW	270W	315NW	360N degrees

Therefore, for our purposes, if the DF unit is located on a vehicle, with an omnidirectional antenna 
with 3dB of gain and the signal is coming from the NE with good signal, the APRS comment would be: 
DFS6030 042 For a fixed station with a directional gain to the SE, the same report would look like this: 
DFS6033 042
